# Console Battleship
Battleship game that can be played in the terminal.

Battleship V1 was built when I was first exposed to programming. I decided to
recreate it in Battleship V2 after 4 years of formal computer science education
to compare how my programming style has developed.

Note: The game prompts appear buggy on Windows CMD.

To run Battleship V2, navigate to the directory and run the commands:
```
cd src
javac Battleship.java Ocean.java Move.java ShipGenerator.java
java Battleship
```
