# Terminal Battleship
Battleship game that can be played in the terminal.

Battleship V1 was built when I was first exposed to programming. I decided to
recreate it in Battleship V2 after 4 years to compare how my programming style has developed.

Note: The game prompts appear buggy on Windows CMD.

To run Battleship V2, first navigate to the directory and compile `Battleship.java`, `Ocean.java`, `Move.java`, and `ShipGenerator.java` as follows:
```
cd src
javac Battleship.java Ocean.java Move.java ShipGenerator.java
java Battleship
```
